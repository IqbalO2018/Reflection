This week I learned how to use functions such as "string", "Boolean", and using algebraic functions to solve mathamatic problems. The most 
important aspect of the mathamatic function we learned I beleive was the mathamatic functions. My personal favorite function is the variable, and raw
input function mainly because they play a key role in eachothers work. In order to create a raw input you need to define a variable and figure out
what is does.

This week I learned how touse python command endings like ".py" and also I 
Learned how the new commands work to use bulliton points on github, using "#" before words and phrases.
Also one important prospect i've reached is the ability to understand errors by looking at them and testing them with github. I can finally use github to my own advantage, and work at ease.

This week I had worked on using the commands that control the files and directories of the terminal on puTTy.
An important process I learned was the way I add and remove directories. 
To add a directory I need to type in "mkdir" and to remove is "rmdir".
I learned to create a file typing "Touch" and then removing the file is Rm "file name".
I've learned a lot this week!
