This week I mostly worked on my hw6, but I also learned how to use "while",
 and "for" clause. These clauses are used for creating loops in the code 
to repeat certain functions. I used this a lot in my hw6 code. This heled me 
tremendously. The amount of work I also put in my project was very ampul, I 
got very far in my Soduko project.

This week most of my work was worked towrds homework5. It consisted of a lot
of old code that we did before, but it all worked out. The important thing 
i learned about python this week was the use of "if" and "else" clause. These
clauses helped me a lot because they determined what my code will do and how everything willbe processed the way i want it to. If clause basically 
determined "if": I make a variable do something, then I use "else" to make it
do something "else" besides my "if" clause.

This week my class worked on multiple types of activites,such as using the 
"and, or, else, if" commands. These helped us develope programs on our
 practice documents. Like yesterday we made a grade calculator. We inputed the
grade and it would convert it to a letter grade, for example if i type "80"
it would give me a "B" this worked because we typed out code saying
 "if grade is greater to or equal 80 then it is a "B". this really helped me 
understand the total reason "and or and if" is used for.

This week I learned tons of information on strings. The first practice we did 
with string was making certain types of functions have variables.
To break this down, we made definitions for certain functions.
The pypractice consisted of functions that broke down a word by letters and
reversed the spelling as well. We made commands to make the user type in words
and the program would break down the word, explain how many letters are in 
the words, and skip certain letters to reverse the spelling. Towards the end of
the week we created madlibs that also had strings in it to describe
the nouns,verbs,adjectives, and names in order to tell the story. I learned how to make the madlibs actually work, and insert commands
that the user can use to create there own story, and I also learned
how easy this became when I kept repeating the process, and clones it.
This changedthe entire weeks progress because we had limited time to do
our work, which challenged us to see how much work we get done in a time limit.

This week I learned how to use functions such as "string", "Boolean", and using algebraic functions to solve mathamatic problems. The most 
important aspect of the mathamatic function we learned I beleive was the mathamatic functions. My personal favorite function is the variable, and raw
input function mainly because they play a key role in eachothers work. In order to create a raw input you need to define a variable and figure out
what is does.

This week I learned how touse python command endings like ".py" and also I 
Learned how the new commands work to use bulliton points on github, using "#" before words and phrases.
Also one important prospect i've reached is the ability to understand errors by looking at them and testing them with github. I can finally use github to my own advantage, and work at ease.

This week I had worked on using the commands that control the files and directories of the terminal on puTTy.
An important process I learned was the way I add and remove directories. 
To add a directory I need to type in "mkdir" and to remove is "rmdir".
I learned to create a file typing "Touch" and then removing the file is Rm "file name".
I've learned a lot this week!
