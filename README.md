This week I learned tons of information on strings. The first practice we did 
with string was making certain types of functions have variables.
To break this down, we made definitions for certain functions.
The pypractice consisted of functions that broke down a word by letters and
reversed the spelling as well. We made commands to make the user type in words
and the program would break down the word, explain how many letters are in 
the words, and skip certain letters to revers the spelling. Towards the end of
the week we created madlibs that also had strings in it to describe
the nouns,verbs,adjectives, and names in order to tell the story. This changed
the entire weeks progress because we had limited time to do our work, which
challenged us to see how much work we get done in a time limit.

This week I learned how to use functions such as "string", "Boolean", and using algebraic functions to solve mathamatic problems. The most 
important aspect of the mathamatic function we learned I beleive was the mathamatic functions. My personal favorite function is the variable, and raw
input function mainly because they play a key role in eachothers work. In order to create a raw input you need to define a variable and figure out
what is does.

This week I learned how touse python command endings like ".py" and also I 
Learned how the new commands work to use bulliton points on github, using "#" before words and phrases.
Also one important prospect i've reached is the ability to understand errors by looking at them and testing them with github. I can finally use github to my own advantage, and work at ease.

This week I had worked on using the commands that control the files and directories of the terminal on puTTy.
An important process I learned was the way I add and remove directories. 
To add a directory I need to type in "mkdir" and to remove is "rmdir".
I learned to create a file typing "Touch" and then removing the file is Rm "file name".
I've learned a lot this week!
